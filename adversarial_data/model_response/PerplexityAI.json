Endemic skeletal fluorosis is widely prevalent in India and is a major public health problem. The first-ever report of endemic skeletal fluorosis and neurological manifestation was from Prakasam district in Andhra Pradesh in the year 1937[1][3]. The neurological complications of endemic skeletal fluorosis, such as radiculopathy and myelopathy, are mechanical in nature, and evidence for direct neurotoxicity of fluoride is lacking[1][3]. Surgery has a limited role in alleviating the neurological disability and should be tailored to the individual based on the imaging findings[1]. The book \"Endemic Skeletal Fluorosis\" authored by D. Raja Reddy provides insights into this important public health issue[2][5].",

The CCRP pursued a broad program of research and analysis in C2 theory, doctrine, applications, systems, the implications of emerging technology, and C2 experimentation[1][2]. It also served as a bridge between the operational and technical communities and supported the coalescence of a knowledgeable and energized command, control, and transformation community[2][4]. The program was housed within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (NII) and was led by Dr. David S. Alberts[2]. In 2015, a non-profit entity, the International Command and Control Institute (IC2I), assumed responsibility for the annual International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium[2].",

The program pursued a broad program of research and analysis in C2 theory, doctrine, applications, systems, the implications of emerging technology, and C2 experimentation. It also developed new concepts for C2 in joint, combined, and coalition operations in the context of both traditional and non-traditional missions[2]. The CCRP also supported professional military education in the areas of C2, Information Superiority, network-centric operations, and related technologies[2]. The program was known for hosting the International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium (ICCRTS), which provided an opportunity for professional researchers, academics, and policy makers to interact and understand the state of the art of C2[3]. The CCRP was aimed at developing a better understanding of the implications of the Information Age for national security[4]. It was also involved in exploring the paradigm shift in the age of the Information Environment and reviewing the current joint definitions of command and control[5].",

The study was set up to address two health and social policy questions of importance before the establishment of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948[3]. The survey began with interviews of 13,687 mothers who had given birth in England, Wales, and Scotland during a week in March 1946, and it has continued with a sample of 5,362 of the children using regular follow-ups to explore the impact of the NHS on health and to explore differences in child development by factors like social class, health, and education[2][3]. As of 2016, it has continued and has developed into a study of aging[2]. The NSHD has informed British health care, education, and social policy since its inception[4]. Today, with study members in their seventies, the NSHD offers a unique opportunity to explore the long-term biological and social processes of aging and how aging is affected by factors acting across the whole of life[4]. The study has also been used to compare with data from other longitudinal studies in Britain and elsewhere[3]. The NSHD has been funded by the Medical Research Council since 1962[4].",

As of 2016, it has continued and has developed into a study of aging[1][2]. The study is designed to look into the cost of childbirth and the working of medical and nursing services (pre-NHS), and it follows the lives of about 5,000 people all born in the same week in 1946[3][4][5].",

It is the oldest and longest-running continually studied British birth cohort study, following a sample of 5,362 men and women born in England, Scotland, and Wales since their birth in one week in March 1946[2][4]. The study was set up to address two health and social policy questions of importance before the establishment of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948. The first question aimed to understand the falling national fertility rate, while the second question focused on the national distribution and use of obstetric medical and midwifery services[3]. The NSHD has informed British health care, education, and social policy since its inception[4]. Today, with study members in their seventies, the NSHD offers a unique opportunity to explore the long-term biological and social processes of aging and how aging is affected by factors acting across the whole of life[4].

The study has been funded by the Medical Research Council since 1962 and has provided valuable insights into various aspects of human development and health[4].\n\nThe NSHD has been linked to various data sources, including mortality, emigration, cancer registrations, and Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data, and has also launched the Insight 46 neuroscience sub-study, which includes brain scan imaging linked to neurological, cognitive, sensory testing, and more, to provide insights into healthy brain aging and the development of dementia[4].\n\nIn conclusion, the National Survey of Health & Development is a significant and influential study that has provided valuable insights into human development, health, and aging, and has informed various health care, education, and social policies in Britain[1][2][3][4].",

The study began with interviews of 13,687 mothers who had given birth in England, Wales, and Scotland during a week in March 1946, and continued with a sample of 5,362 of the children using regular follow-ups to explore the impact of the National Health Service on health and to explore differences in child development by factors like social class, health, and education[2]. As of 2016, it has continued and has itself developed into a study of aging[2]. The study covers various aspects of health and development and has been influential in shaping health policies and understanding human development[2].",

He later pursued a PhD in Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in the United States[2][3][5]. After completing his doctoral work, he addressed how temporal gene expression and antibody specificities contribute toward the repertoire of B lymphocytes in various lymphoid organs in mice[2]. Dr. Ravichandran has made significant contributions to the understanding of apoptotic cell clearance mechanisms in health and disease[3][4]. He is currently the Robert L. Kroc Professor of Pathology and Immunology at Washington University and has been recognized as a 'Highly Cited Researcher' with top 1% publications in the past decade[1][2][5]. His research interests include engulfment of apoptotic cells and the impact of dead cell removal on human inflammatory diseases[2][3].\n\nIn 1996, Dr. Ravichandran joined the University of Virginia School of Medicine as an Assistant Professor and has since been promoted to Professor and Chair of the Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology[2][5]. He has authored numerous articles in peer-reviewed journals, including multiple publications in top biomedical journals such as Cell, Nature, Science, Nature Immunology, and Nature Cell Biology[5]. Dr. Ravichandran is also a recognized world leader in the fields of apoptosis and cell clearance, and has been an invited or plenary speaker in many national and international meetings[5].",

The unit made significant scientific achievements, including the refinement of the genetics of the MNS antigen system and the discovery of the Xg antigen system, the first X-linked blood group to be discovered in 1962[1][2]. The discovery of the ABO blood group system is credited to Karl Landsteiner in 1900, and at present, 33 blood group systems representing over 300 antigens are recognized[3]. The Duffy blood group antigen (Fy) was first discovered in 1950[4]. The MRC Blood Group Unit was renowned for its work in the highly specialized field of haematology and genetics of blood groups[2].",

The need for safe transfusion therapy intensified blood group research in the run-up to the Second World War, and in 1940 Landsteiner and Wiener discovered the Rh factor, building on foundations laid by Levine and Stetson in 1939.

The International Society of Blood Transfusion has recognized 33 blood group systems, and apart from the ABO and Rhesus systems, many other types of antigens have been noticed on the red cell membranes. Understanding the blood group system is crucial for preventing transfusion-related complications and approaching blood group-linked diseases, which are still at the stage of research[3].\n\nThe MRC Blood Group Unit succeeded the Galton Laboratory Serum Unit set up in 1935 under the direction of Professor Ronald Fisher and was reconstituted at the Lister Institute for Preventive Medicine as the Blood Group Research Unit in 1946. The unit acquired an international reputation in the highly specialized field of hematology, extending its work in 1965 into the genetics of blood groups. Upon the retirement of Dr. Race in 1973, Dr. Ruth Sanger became the director of the unit[2].\n\nIn summary, the MRC Blood Group Unit was a significant research unit that made substantial contributions to the study of blood groups and their implications in human genetics and transfusion medicine.",

The unit was reconstituted at the Lister Institute for Preventive Medicine as the Blood Group Research Unit in 1946, under the directorship of Dr. Robert Race. It acquired an international reputation in the highly specialized field of hematology, extending its work in 1965 into the genetics of blood groups[4]. \n\nThe MRC Molecular Haematology Unit (MRC MHU) at the University of Oxford is a modern-day research unit that aims to understand how mature blood cells are normally made from stem cells and how this process is perturbed in common blood disorders. The unit includes 14 research teams with over 140 scientists who share a common goal to improve the prognosis of patients with inherited and acquired blood diseases[1][2][3]. The MRC MHU studies how these processes are perturbed in acquired and inherited blood diseases, such as thalassemia, myelodysplasia, and leukemias[3]. The unit collaborates closely with other groups in the MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at the University of Oxford[3].",

The unit mainly used serological techniques to discover blood group antigens. Only in the last 15 years of its existence were monoclonal antibodies and molecular approaches adopted. Blood groups were used to study many aspects of human genetics, including those related to blood transfusion, linkage analysis, mosaicism, and chimaerism[1][2]. Karl Landsteiner is credited with the discovery of the ABO blood group system in 1900, which led to the identification of major blood groups such as O, A, and B types, compatibility testing, and subsequent transfusion practices[3].",

The unit mainly used serological techniques to discover blood group antigens. Only in the last 15 years of its existence were monoclonal antibodies and molecular approaches adopted. Blood groups were used to study many aspects of human genetics, including those related to blood transfusion, linkage analysis, mosaicism, and chimaerism. The unit made significant scientific achievements, such as the discovery of the Xg antigen system, the refinement of the genetics of the MNS antigen system, and the establishment of the WHO Collaborative Centre for Human Blood Groups[1][2].",

The experiments have been widely criticized for using Indian troops as test subjects without their consent and for the severe burns and illnesses inflicted on the soldiers. The British Ministry of Defense has acknowledged that at least 20,000 British soldiers were subjected to chemical warfare trials at the Porton Down research center in southwest England between 1916 and 1989[1][2][3][4].\n\nThe experiments have been referred to as the Rawalpindi experiments or Rawalpindi mustard gas experiments in the media and elsewhere.

The experiments aimed to test the effects of mustard gas on Indian soldiers' skin compared to British soldiers. More than 20,000 British servicemen were subjected to chemical warfare trials between 1916 and 1989 at the Defence Ministry's Porton Down research center in southwest England[1]. The tests caused large numbers of burns, some of which were so damaging that the subjects had to be hospitalized. Severely burned patients were often very miserable and depressed and in considerable discomfort, but no long-term effects of exposure were documented or studied[1][2].",

More than 20,000 British servicemen were subjected to chemical warfare trials between 1916 and 1989 at the Defence Ministry's Porton Down research center in southwest England. The experiments focused on mustard gas, which is now known to be highly carcinogenic. The soldiers, wearing shorts and cotton shirts, were placed in gas chambers and many suffered severe burns from the exposure. Some of the subjects had to be hospitalized due to the damaging effects of the gas. The experiments have been criticized for their unethical nature and the lack of long-term studies on the effects of exposure[1][3].",

The book describes the careers of publicly employed scientists who, in the course of their work for government agencies, found habitat degradation, threatened species, or other decline in availability of a natural resource. When they expressed their views that certain activities must be scaled back or areas protected, they met with poor job performance ratings, hostility from their supervisors, transfers out of the region, and in many cases a severely damaged career. The book tells eight stories of \"combat biologists\" daring to question the environmental protocols of their superiors in agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Fish and Wildlife Service. According to Wilkinson, officials in these agencies ask agency staffers to rewrite reports to make them more development-friendly, even if it means lying about statistics and methodology, and then to transfer or fire workers who refuse to comply[3][5].",

Elston was a renowned artist and educator, known for her lifelong engagement with art and youth education. She earned a Bachelor's degree from Yale and a Master of Fine Arts in painting and sculpture from the University of Chicago. Elston taught art in Chicago Public Schools for several decades and ran her own art academy for 15 years. She also exhibited and sold artwork throughout her lifetime. Elston was involved in various community art projects and contributed to the Lake Shore Drive underpasses at Bryn Mawr, Foster, and Belmont. She created a twelve-foot relief sculpture and a forty-foot wall mural at Senn High School. Elston was a distinguished figure in the art and education community, and her impact on her students and the community was profound. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Elston was a statistical geneticist or a distinguished professor emeritus at multiple universities, including Case Western Reserve University. Therefore, the claim that Elston was a British-born statistical geneticist and a distinguished professor emeritus at 10,000 universities, including Case Western Reserve University, is not supported by the search results.",

The study focused on studying normal and pathological brain aging and included interviews and follow-ups at 1, 3, and 5 years after the initial data collection. The identification of demented cases was made using a two-stage design, involving screening by psychologists and confirmation of the diagnosis by a neurologist[1]. The study also explored the relationship between depressive symptoms and dementia incidence in older adults, with a focus on sex differences[2]. The PAQUID cohort has provided valuable insights into aging, dementia, and functional trajectories in the elderly population, contributing to a better understanding of these important health issues[4].\n\nThe PAQUID cohort is part of the major cohorts developed by the research teams at the Bordeaux Population Health Center, providing opportunities for population monitoring and research studies[3]. This cohort has been instrumental in studying the natural history of dependency in the elderly, using a longitudinal item response theory model over 24 years of follow-up[4]. Additionally, the study has contributed to the exploration of subjective quality of life proxies for older adults in epidemiologic research[5].",

The PAQUID research program was designed to study prospectively a representative random sample of people aged 65 years and over living in Gironde and Dordogne, two administrative areas in the south-west of France. Subjects were randomly chosen from the electoral rolls of 75 parishes. Three criteria had to be met for subjects to be included in the study: to be at least 65 years of age by 31 December 1987, to be living at home at the time of the initial data collection phase, and to have given their informed consent to participate in the study[4]. The study was conducted in a random sample of subjects aged over 65 years and living at home at baseline in Gironde and Dordogne, France[5]. The PAQUID study collected sociodemographic data, including age, sex, and education level, with four levels: no schooling, primary school level, secondary school level, and university level[4]. The study provided estimates of survival after the onset of dementia by age, sex, self-reported health, disability, and severity of cognitive impairment[2]. Additionally, the PAQUID study examined the relationship between IgE level and Phadiatop® in an elderly population, in relation to respiratory symptoms and smoking[3]. The PAQUID cohort has been the subject of various research studies, including investigations into anticholinergic medication burden and incident dementia and stroke in older adults[1].",

It involved a sample of 3,777 participants living at home and aged 65 and older, which was representative of the general population in terms of age and gender. The study aimed to gather data to study normal and pathological brain aging, and it has been used to compute norms on several neuropsychological tests for the oldest old[5].\n\nThe PAQUID cohort has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of aging, dementia, and related conditions, and it continues to be a valuable resource for ongoing research in this field.",

It was designed to study a representative random sample of people aged 65 years and over living in Gironde and Dordogne, two administrative areas in the southwest of France. The study aimed to investigate various aspects of aging, including cognitive function, disability, and the incidence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease[4][5].\n\nThe PAQUID study collected baseline data, including age, sex, and education level, with four categories: no schooling, primary school level, secondary school level, and university level. The study found that lower education was associated with a higher risk of dementia, and the risk of Alzheimer's disease increased with age, but the effect of education on the risk of Alzheimer's disease was independent of age and sex[4].\n\nThe study also examined the relationship between anticholinergic medication burden and incident dementia and stroke in older adults. It found that the use of anticholinergics was higher in certain populations, such as the ASPREE study, compared to the PAQUID cohort, and that the overall burden of anticholinergics was influenced by differences in medication classification[1].\n\nIn summary, the PAQUID cohort study provides valuable insights into the aging process, cognitive function, and the incidence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease in the elderly population, contributing to our understanding of these important health issues.",

Bates attributed nearly all sight problems to habitual strain of the eyes and believed that glasses were harmful and never necessary. His techniques centered on visualization, movement, and exposure to sunlight. However, the Bates method has not been objectively shown to improve eyesight and has been criticized by visual scientists[1][2]. Despite continued anecdotal reports of successful results, including support by Aldous Huxley, most of Bates' claims and theories have been considered false by visual scientists[1]. The Bates Method is largely concerned with improving eyesight or acuity, seeking to improve short-sightedness, astigmatism, and long-sightedness[2]. While there are anecdotal reports of successful results, the method has not been objectively shown to improve eyesight[2]. The Bates method has been criticized for its ineffectiveness and potential dangers, and its popularity has largely been attributed to \"flashes of clear vision\" experienced by many who followed it[2]. Therefore, the Bates method is not considered an effective approach to improving eyesight.",

He was a member of the Electroencephalography Society and served as its president from 1976-78[2]. Bates was known for his wide interests, including learning Italian, writing a paper on gestures of the hand, music, art, architecture, and building a house in the garden of his home[2]. He correctly diagnosed his own cerebral lesions[2]. John Alexander Vincent Bates passed away in 1993[1].",

It empowers practitioners to identify and address the issues and needs of their practice, develop and test innovative solutions, and enhance professional development and collaboration[2]. However, practitioner research can be challenging as it requires time, resources, and support that may not be readily available, and it often faces resistance and skepticism from within and outside the practice[2]. Practitioner research is a distinct form of research that should be implemented in practice and education, as it promotes learning on the job and contributes to the empowerment of professionals who are actively involved in constructing local knowledge and improving practice with stakeholders[3].",

Practitioner research involves individuals who work in a professional field and perform research and/or workplace research, such as evaluation, as opposed to being full-time academic researchers[2]. It is intended to solve problems, enhance practice, and improve the quality of the practitioner-researcher's practice[2]. Practitioner research is embedded in teachers' daily routines and is contextualized from students' responses to hypothesize and explore effective instructional practices[3]. It is also seen as an effective model of inquiry-based continuing professional development, embodying the notion of a teacher as a lifelong learner[1]. The movement has been shaped and reshaped through the years, with various versions and variances, including action research, teacher research, practitioner inquiry, and self-study, all targeting the practitioner's role in generating knowledge from practice[5]. Therefore, practitioner research has indeed developed as a recognized type of research, particularly among educators.",

The emergence of practitioner research as an acknowledged form of inquiry can be traced back to the late 20th century and has continued to evolve since then. Research in the 19th century primarily focused on medical practices, obstetric care, and the evolving role of medical practitioners in pregnancy and childbirth.\n\nIn the late 19th century, there were significant developments in obstetric care and medical interventions related to pregnancy. However, the formal acknowledgment and establishment of practitioner research as a distinct form of inquiry occurred much later. The 19th century saw advancements in obstetric literature, the development of new obstetric instruments, and the emergence of medical debates surrounding maternal and child welfare[4][5].\n\nThe 20th century witnessed a shift towards a more systematic and research-oriented approach to medical practice, leading to the formal recognition of practitioner research as an essential component of medical inquiry. This shift was influenced by the increasing emphasis on evidence-based medicine and the integration of research into clinical practice[1][5].\n\nTherefore, it is more accurate to attribute the acknowledgment of practitioner research as a distinct form of inquiry to the 20th century, rather than the 19th century.",

The emergence of practitioner research as a recognized form of inquiry is a more recent development. Historical research has primarily focused on the emergence of social policies focused on maternal and child welfare, and the dominant framework for the analysis of historical change in pregnancy and childbirth across the social sciences has been the theory of medicalization, which emerged during the 1970s[1][2]. The 19th century saw immense obstetric literature and the development of new obstetric instruments, but most practitioners active in obstetrics were exclusively members of the Obstetrical Society, and no other body, institution, or medical college took an interest in obstetrics as a branch of medicine[4]. Therefore, practitioner research as an acknowledged form of inquiry did not emerge in the final trimester of the 19th century.",

It refers to research and/or workplace evaluation performed by individuals who work in a professional field, such as nurses, teachers, counselors, or social workers, as opposed to full-time academic researchers[1]. Practitioner research involves one or more people who are both practitioners and researchers, aiming to solve problems and enhance practice, rather than developing theory[3]. This type of research is conducted by individuals or groups who assume a dual role as practitioners or providers of services and as researchers, and it is typically carried out to advance practice[2]. Practitioner research is seen as an effective model of inquiry-based continuing professional development, embodying the notion of a teacher as a lifelong learner[3]. It offers a reflective and systematic approach to research and outreach, placing the study setting and participants at the heart of the study[2]. The aim of practitioner research is to generate new knowledge and promote research that is joined up, breaking the academic, fragmented approach to knowledge[4].",

According to Wikipedia, \"Practitioner research developed as a recognized type of research in the last quarter of the 20th century\"[1]. This type of research refers to research and/or workplace research performed by individuals who work in a professional field, such as nurses, teachers, counselors, or social workers, as opposed to being full-time academic researchers. It has been recognized that all disciplines could approach practitioner research in broadly the same way[1]. Therefore, practitioner research has become an established and important type of research, particularly in fields where practical experience and expertise are crucial.\n\nThis development is significant as it allows practitioners to conduct research alongside their practice, which can assist in solving specific problems, contributing to the learning of a discipline, and influencing government policy. Practitioner research has two categories: research in the workplace, such as service evaluation or needs assessment, and academic research related to the practitioner's role, such as a master's degree or PhD in a relevant subject[1]. This recognition has contributed to the improvement of the quality of the practitioner-researcher's practice and has led to the need to develop practitioners as scientists in various fields[5].",

This type of research aims to solve specific problems, contribute to the learning of a discipline, influence government policy, and improve the quality of the practitioner-researcher's practice[1]. Practitioner research is seen as an empowering and developmental tool for teachers, allowing them to improve their practice through systematic investigation and continuous learning[2]. It can also enhance professional development and collaboration, as practitioners share their findings and insights with their peers, colleagues, and stakeholders[3]. The development of practitioner research has promoted action research for practitioners to develop critical appraisal and analysis of practice, appropriate to professional contexts[4]. This type of research is conducted by individuals or groups assuming a dual role as practitioners and researchers, and it offers a reflective and systematic approach to research that places the study setting and participants at the heart of the study[5].",

In fact, nursing research, which is closely related to practitioner research, began to advance significantly only in the 20th century, particularly in the 1950s, due to various factors[1]. In nineteenth-century America, there were professionals and scientists, but there was no such person as a \"professional scientist\"[2][3]. The concept of practitioner research, as it is understood today, seems to have emerged much later, as evidenced by contemporary discussions and literature on the topic[4][5]. Therefore, it is safe to say that practitioner research did not develop as a recognized type of research in the last quarter of the 19th century.",

While the search did not yield specific information about the Center for Climate and Life, it is known that climate change can have significant impacts on the availability and distribution of resources. For example, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can affect agricultural productivity and water availability, which in turn can impact food and water resources. Additionally, extreme weather events and rising sea levels can threaten shelter and infrastructure, while shifts in energy production and consumption may be necessary to mitigate and adapt to climate change.\n\nThe Climate Change Resource Center (CCRC) provides information about climate change impacts on forests and other ecosystems, and approaches to adaptation and mitigation in forests and grasslands[2]. This indicates that research institutions and organizations are actively studying the impacts of climate change on various resources, including food, water, shelter, and energy.\n\nFurthermore, California is implementing statewide organic waste recycling and surplus food recovery as part of its response to the climate crisis[4]. This demonstrates a practical application of addressing surplus resources such as food in the context of climate change.\n\nIn summary, while specific information about the Center for Climate and Life's research focus was not found, it is evident that various organizations and initiatives are actively studying and addressing the ways in which climate change affects access to surplus resources such as food, water, shelter, and energy.",

The center's mission includes funding high-risk, high-reward research that helps society understand and generate solutions to climate change, as well as building partnerships with private and public organizations[1][2][3]. Climate change has been shown to exacerbate preexisting disparities in access to clean water and affordable food, affecting the poorest countries and people the most[4]. The water, food, and energy nexus is at the heart of sustainable development, with agriculture being the largest consumer of freshwater resources and energy generation being water-intensive. Pressure on this nexus threatens the Sustainable Development Goals, and governments are encouraged to increase support for less water-intensive renewable energy sources and to value ecosystems for their vital services[5].",

Henderson's current research focuses on the mechanisms by which opioid drugs affect the central nervous system, particularly studying the cellular mechanisms by which tolerance is developed to opioid drugs and how that tolerance may be reduced by other drugs, enhancing the likelihood of opioid overdose[1][2]. His work has contributed to understanding the dangers of opioid overdose and how they may be altered by other drugs, using a reverse translational approach by interviewing heroin users to gather their views on opioid overdose dangers[1]. Henderson's research has also delved into the interactions between benzodiazepines and opioids to develop new harm reduction strategies[1]. His work has been published in various academic journals and has been cited in the field of pharmacology and toxicology[1].",

He is a professor of pharmacology in the School of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience at the University of Bristol. His current research focuses on the mechanisms by which opioid drugs affect the central nervous system, particularly studying the cellular mechanisms by which tolerance is developed to opioid drugs and how that tolerance may be reduced by other drugs such as ethanol and pregabalin, enhancing the likelihood of opioid overdose[1][4].\n\nHenderson's research aims to understand the lethality of opioid drugs such as heroin, methadone, and fentanyl in opioid overdose and how their lethality, through depression of respiration, can be enhanced by other drugs such as alcohol and gabapentinoids. He has demonstrated that the mechanisms underlying tolerance may be different for different opioids and that alcohol and gabapentinoids lower heroin but not methadone tolerance[4].\n\nFurthermore, fentanyls, a class of drug with high potency and rapid onset of respiratory depression, are more likely to lead to overdose than other opioids. Henderson's research also delves into the complex pharmacology of fentanyls and their contribution to lethality, including their high intrinsic efficacy and reduced cross-tolerance to other opioids[3][5].\n\nIn summary, Graeme Henderson's research is focused on understanding the mechanisms of opioid addiction, tolerance development, and the lethality of opioid drugs, including fentanyls, in opioid overdose, as well as how their lethality can be influenced by other drugs such as alcohol and gabapentinoids[1][4].",

He is a professor of pharmacology at the University of Bristol, and his research focuses on understanding the lethality of opioid drugs such as heroin, methadone, and fentanyl in opioid overdose, as well as the development of tolerance to opioids and the interactions of opioids with other drugs such as alcohol and gabapentinoids[1][3]. His work has contributed to understanding the mechanisms by which opioid drugs affect the central nervous system and how tolerance to opioids may be reduced by other drugs, enhancing the likelihood of opioid overdose[3]. Henderson's research has significant implications for addressing the global issue of opioid addiction and overdose[2]. While he is a respected figure in the field of opioid research, it would be inaccurate to describe him as encompassing the totality of knowledge on opioid addiction, as this is a complex and multifaceted area of study involving many researchers and experts worldwide.",

Her research focuses on the establishment and maintenance of pluripotent embryonic cells, which are capable of becoming any type of cell in the body, and how these cells differentiate into specific cell types. She has been granted permission to use the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technique on human embryos to better understand the earliest stages of human development[1][2][3]. The goal of her research is to provide fundamental insights into human embryogenesis and drive clinical translation, with potential implications for understanding infertility, miscarriages, developmental disorders, and therapeutic applications of stem cells[2]. The CRISPR-Cas9 technique allows highly efficient and precise alterations of the DNA sequence, and Dr. Niakan's team uses it to inactivate genes that may be important for early development and investigate their role[3]. However, studies assessing gene correction in early human embryos report low efficiency of mutation repair, high rates of mosaicism, and the possibility of unintended editing outcomes that may have pathologic consequences[4]. Dr. Niakan's work underscores the importance of further basic research to assess the safety of genome editing techniques in human embryos, which will inform debates about the potential clinical use of this technology[4]. She has also developed an optimized protocol for efficient CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing of human pluripotent stem cells to investigate the functional role of genes by engineering null mutations[5].",

                    "text": "Kathy Niakan is a developmental biologist known for her pioneering work on CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology in human developmental and stem cell biology. In February 2016, Dr. Niakan's team became the first to receive permission from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to use the CRISPR-Cas9 technique in human embryos[1]. This technique allows her team to better understand the earliest stages of human development by inactivating genes in human embryos at the one-cell stage[1]. The significance of the HFEA license for this work is that it is the first time genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9 has been approved[1]. Dr. Niakan's team introduces the Cas9 protein and guide RNAs into human embryos at the one-cell stage with the aim of inactivating genes[1].\n\nHowever, studies assessing gene correction in early human embryos using CRISPR-Cas9 report low efficiency of mutation repair, high rates of mosaicism, and the possibility of unintended editing outcomes that may have pathologic consequences[2]. These unintended outcomes were present in approximately 16% of the human embryo cells analyzed and spanned 4-20 kb[2]. This underscores the importance of further basic research to assess the safety of genome editing techniques in human embryos[2].\n\nDr. Niakan's work also extends to human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), where she has provided an optimized protocol for efficient CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to investigate the functional role of genes by engineering null mutations[3]. This work emphasizes the importance of screening single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to identify those with high targeting efficiency for the generation of clonally derived null mutant hPSC lines[3].\n\nIn summary, Kathy Niakan's research has significantly contributed to the understanding of human developmental biology and stem cell research through the application of CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology in human embryos and pluripotent stem cells. Her work has provided valuable insights into the earliest stages of human development and the functional role of genes in hPSCs, while also highlighting the need for further research to assess the safety of genome editing techniques in human embryos[1][2][3].",

It also facilitates the sharing of information on the outcomes of inspections conducted by European Economic Area (EEA) authorities with regulatory authorities elsewhere in the world[2]. Certificates of GMP are issued to manufacturers by the national competent authority if the outcome of the inspection confirms compliance with the principles of GMP as provided by European Union legislation[3]. Similarly, certificates of Good Distribution Practice (GDP) are issued to wholesale distributors by the national competent authority if compliance with GDP is confirmed[3].

The promotion and merchandise aided the success of the song, which became the biggest-selling single of all time[5]. The merchandise, including t-shirts, sold well, and the video cassette documenting the making of the song became the ninth-best-selling video of 1985[1]. Additionally, USA for Africa officials estimated that they had sold between $45 million and $47 million worth of official merchandise around the world, and one year after the release of the song, organizers noted that $44.5 million had been raised for USA for Africa's humanitarian fund[1]. By October 1986, the total amount of money raised had exceeded the initial target of $50 million, reaching $51.2 million[1].

All proceeds from the sale of official USA for Africa merchandise went directly to the famine relief fund.

Despite rumors and social media speculation, the song did not make it to the Billboard Top 100 or the US top 200 daily songs lists around the time of the submersible incident[2][3][4][5]. The song's popularity did not surge as claimed, and it did not receive over 7 million streams on Spotify in the week following the tragedy[2][3][4][5]. The song's streaming numbers did not show a significant increase, and it did not cross into the Top 100 on major album and streaming charts[5]. Therefore, the assertion that the song entered the Billboard Top 100 after the submersible tragedy is not supported by the available evidence.",

His writing is often characterized by refined rhymes and surprising, sometimes surreal imagery. Since his debut in 1962, he has repeatedly reinvented his songs and music. In his Nobel Lecture in Literature, Dylan reflected on the connection between his songs and literature, expressing his thoughts on the matter[5].",

The novel's main plotline was based on a true-crime story taken from the police archives of Paris, about a man who suffered false political imprisonment after being betrayed by a group of jealous friends[3]. The Count of Monte Cristo explores six core themes: revenge, justice and God's will, happiness, love and redemption, identity, and the domestic[4]. The novel's protagonist, Edmond Dantès, seeks revenge against those who wronged him, and the story delves into themes of justice, love, and redemption[4]. The Black Count: Glory, Revolution, Betrayal, and the Real Count of Monte Cristo is a 2012 biography of General Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, who served as the inspiration for the character in the novel[2].",

It portrays a society where men held higher positions than women, who were often treated more like objects than people[1][2][3][4]. In Homer's time, men supported the families and protected them because their role was more dominant, while women were rarely considered their own individuals but always an extension of their husband, father, or brother[4]. The portrayal of women in The Iliad reflects the societal norms of ancient Greece, where women were taught to accept the rules of men in authority above them because they lacked the same rights as males[4]. The role of females in The Iliad is depicted as demoting and inferior to men, with women being treated like slaves and property rather than human beings[4]. The poem centers on the brutality and gruesome aspect of war, making it difficult to visualize any room for the tenderness of women when it comes to battle, although they play a crucial role behind the scenes by supporting and giving advice to the warriors[4]. Therefore, The Iliad is often seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles and portraying women in a subordinate position to men.",

Agamemnon incurs the wrath of Achilles after claiming one of his concubines as his own, resulting in Achilles withdrawing himself and his army from the Achaean forces completely[5]. The poem is known for its portrayal of significant events in the Trojan War and explores themes of mortality, glory, and fate[5]. The Iliad is considered one of the oldest works in Western literature, typically dated back to the 8th century BCE[5]. The masculine and heroic nature of the Iliad is evident in its focus on the heroic deeds and conflicts of the warriors, as well as the themes of honor, pride, and the pursuit of glory[5].",

They have real feelings, real plans, and are able to accomplish them on their own. Unlike in the Iliad, where women are chiefly prizes to be won, bereft of identity, the women of the Odyssey are unique in their personality, intentions, and relationship towards men[1][2][3].

It is considered a masculine epic due to its focus on war, heroism, and the portrayal of male characters. The Iliad contains detailed descriptions of ancient war and portrays the theme of heroism through different characters, such as Achilles, Hector, and Patroclus[1][2][3]. The notion of personal honor is prevalent throughout the Iliad, and the hero's duty was to fight and gain glory and immortality through heroic action on the battlefield[3]. The Iliad is keenly aware of its role as the keeper of memory and is known for its sympathetic treatment of the Trojans, who are portrayed as fellow victims of the war, not merely enemies[4]. In contrast, the Odyssey, while also an epic, is often seen as more focused on the individual and the journey of its protagonist, Odysseus, and is sometimes considered more diverse in its portrayal of characters and themes[1][2].\n\nThe Iliad's portrayal of heroes and heroism reflects the ancient Greek concept of heroes as humans, male or female, of the remote past, endowed with superhuman abilities and descended from the immortal gods themselves[2]. The hero's duty to fight and gain glory and immortality through heroic action on the battlefield was a central theme in the Iliad, emphasizing the importance of honor and heroism in ancient Greek culture[3].\n\nIn summary, the Iliad is frequently described as a masculine or heroic epic due to its focus on war, heroism, and the portrayal of male characters, particularly in comparison to the Odyssey, which is often seen as more diverse in its portrayal of characters and themes.",

In the Iliad, women are objectified and portrayed in a subservient manner, reflecting the inferiority of women in ancient times[1][3]. On the other hand, the Odyssey features strong female characters such as Penelope and Circe, who play vital and powerful roles, challenging the norms of misogyny in ancient Greek society[1][4]. Homer has provided two interesting archetypes of strong females to consider in both the Iliad and the Odyssey, with the Penelope archetype being frequently extolled as the ideal, virtuous wife for other women to emulate[2]. The portrayal of women in the Odyssey represents a significant departure from the treatment of women in the Iliad, where women are recognized as a force of power and resourcefulness, dominating the men both physically and mentally[5].",

The Iliad portrays the theme of heroism through different characters, mainly Achilles, Hector, and Patroclus. It plays with the idea of heroism and does not make it explicitly clear who the true hero of the story is[1][3]. The concept of heroism in the Iliad confirms that a warrior lives and dies in the pursuit of honor and glory, and it sets the standard for the definition of the word epic: an expansive poem of enormous scope, composed in an archaic and superbly elevated style of language, concerning the wondrous deeds of heroes[3][4]. The poem contains detailed descriptions of ancient war and portrays the theme of heroism in a variety of different ways through different characters[1][5].",

Whether it’s a brave act you read about in a news headline or an event you witnessed yourself, there’s something very moving about extreme displays of heroic character.

The Iliad is frequently described as a masculine or heroic epic, especially when compared with the Odyssey[1]. The Iliad portrays the theme of heroism in a variety of different ways through different characters, mainly Achilles, Hector, and Patroclus[1]. On the other hand, The Odyssey, like its companion poem, The Iliad, is an epic poem, meaning an exalted story of a warrior-like hero's journey and dealings with the gods[3]. The Odyssey tells of a weary man’s fight for survival in the face of threatening Others who can never share his view of the world or take his interests to heart[5]. Therefore, the Odyssey is often considered to have a different focus and tone compared to the Iliad, with a greater emphasis on the personal journey and survival of its protagonist, Odysseus.",

While both are considered foundational works of Western literature, they differ significantly in their themes, narrative styles, and focus.\n\n### Themes and Narrative Styles\nThe Iliad is primarily a tale of war and battle, focusing on the Trojan War and the conflicts between the Achaean and Trojan forces. It delves into themes of heroism, fate, and the interference of gods and goddesses in human affairs. The main plot revolves around the story of Achilles and his struggle with hubris, as well as the fate of Troy. The narrative encompasses multiple plot lines and involves a large cast of characters, both mortal and immortal. The Odyssey, on the other hand, is a story of a journey, centering on the protagonist Odysseus' efforts to return home after the Trojan War. It emphasizes the challenges and adventures encountered by Odysseus as he seeks to reunite with his family.\n\n### Focus and Characters\nThe Iliad is characterized by its focus on the conflict between two nations and the involvement of divine forces, with a wide array of characters and story arcs. In contrast, the Odyssey centers on Odysseus as the main protagonist, with a narrower focus on his personal journey and the challenges he faces.\n\n### Comparison\nThe Iliad is often described as a tale of \"Man vs. Man,\" portraying the epic struggle of war and the complexities of human and divine interactions. The Odyssey, on the other hand, is more focused on the individual hero's quest and the trials he encounters on his way home.\n\nIn summary, while both epics are foundational to Western literature, the Iliad is primarily a story of war and conflict, while the Odyssey is a tale of personal struggle and the journey home.\n\n[1][2][3][4][5]",

The Iliad is a tale of Man vs Man, as the two armies battle over the fate of not only the city but of the woman for whose love a foolish young prince was willing to start a war[2]. The heroic ideal in the Iliad, exemplified by Hector, Patroclus, and Achilles, stands in stark contrast to their heroic foils who stand with their feet firmly planted in the Hesiodic cosmos: Diomedes, Menelaus, and Agamemnon[4]. However, it is important to note that the Iliad is not merely a love story like a romance between two individuals but a love story that brings forth salvation in the cold and dark cosmos governed by lustful strife, war, and rape[4].",

They have real feelings, real plans, and are able to accomplish them on their own. Unlike in the Iliad, where women are chiefly prizes to be won, bereft of identity, the women of the Odyssey are unique in their personality, intentions, and relationship towards men[1][2][3].

It is considered a masculine epic due to its focus on war, heroism, and the portrayal of male characters. The Iliad contains detailed descriptions of ancient war and portrays the theme of heroism through different characters, such as Achilles, Hector, and Patroclus[1][2][3]. The notion of personal honor is prevalent throughout the Iliad, and the hero's duty was to fight and gain glory and immortality through heroic action on the battlefield[3]. The Iliad is keenly aware of its role as the keeper of memory and is known for its sympathetic treatment of the Trojans, who are portrayed as fellow victims of the war, not merely enemies[4]. In contrast, the Odyssey, while also an epic, is often seen as more focused on the individual and the journey of its protagonist, Odysseus, and is sometimes considered more diverse in its portrayal of characters and themes[1][2].\n\nThe Iliad's portrayal of heroes and heroism reflects the ancient Greek concept of heroes as humans, male or female, of the remote past, endowed with superhuman abilities and descended from the immortal gods themselves[2]. The hero's duty to fight and gain glory and immortality through heroic action on the battlefield was a central theme in the Iliad, emphasizing the importance of honor and heroism in ancient Greek culture[3].\n\nIn summary, the Iliad is frequently described as a masculine or heroic epic due to its focus on war, heroism, and the portrayal of male characters, particularly in comparison to the Odyssey, which is often seen as more diverse in its portrayal of characters and themes.",

The film depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality created by intelligent machines to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source[1]. The Matrix's success led to two sequels, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, and the franchise was further expanded through comic books, video games, and an animated anthology film called The Animatrix[1]. The film's philosophical themes are influenced by various philosophical precedents, including Jean Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation, Plato's allegory of the cave, Socrates' visit to the Oracle of Delphi, and the work of Descartes[3]. The Matrix's visual effects, particularly \"bullet time,\" have had a lasting impact on Hollywood and popular culture, with its influence seen in subsequent films, video games, and action sequences[5]. The Matrix is considered a philosophical film that contains many existing philosophical and religious themes, such as prophecy, love, and truth[6]. The film's special effects, including the \"bullet time\" effect, have been noted for their groundbreaking nature, with some effects holding up well over time, while others have aged less gracefully[8].",

This effect, also known as time-slice, is achieved using multiple cameras to give the impression of time slowing down or standing still altogether. The term \"bullet time\" was first used in the original script of the 1999 film 'The Matrix' to describe the iconic scene where bullets glide through the air in slow motion past Neo's head[1]. The effect was achieved on a green screen set with a series of still cameras surrounding the subject, which were activated in rapid succession, and the resulting frames were displayed consecutively with additional CGI interpolated frames, creating the effect of the camera moving faster than the subject[2]. The iconic shot where Neo dodges Agent Smith's bullets required around 120 still cameras, placed one next to the other, to create the illusion of motion[5]. The effect was a major innovation in visual effects and has since become a commonly applied expression in popular culture[4].",

Single frames from each camera were then arranged and displayed consecutively to produce an orbiting viewpoint of an action frozen in time or as hyper-slow-motion[5]. In The Matrix, the effect was achieved on a green screen set with a series of still cameras surrounding the subject, and the resulting frames were displayed consecutively with additional CGI interpolated frames, creating the effect of the camera moving faster than the subject[2].

It creates the impression of time slowing down or standing still by using multiple cameras to capture an action from different angles. The term \"bullet time\" was first used in the original script of The Matrix to describe the iconic scene where bullets glide through the air in slow motion past Neo's head[1][4]. The effect was achieved by using a series of still cameras surrounding the subject, which were fired sequentially or simultaneously, depending on the desired effect. The resulting frames were then displayed consecutively to produce an orbiting viewpoint of an action frozen in time or as hyper-slow-motion[4][7]. The most famous iteration of bullet time in The Matrix, where Neo dodges bullets on a rooftop, involved 120 still cameras and two film cameras[2]. The effect combines gunfight action scenes, superhuman bullet-dodging, and time-slice effects, making it unique[4]. The final touch involved digital elements inside the Matrix, such as the bullets, which had to coincide with the movement, light, and color of the 3D space created by the camera rig, the actors, and the rest of the environment[7]. The bullet time effect requires a complex setup and can involve computer-generated visualizations as guides, as well as lasers[8]. The effect has been used in various media, including films, TV, commercials, and even live events[1].",

                    "text": "The \"bullet time\" effect, also known as the Matrix effect, is a visual impression of detaching the time and space of a camera from that of its visible subject. It is characterized by its extreme transformation of both time and space, allowing the camera angle to move around the scene at a normal speed while events are slowed down. This effect was first popularized in the 1999 film The Matrix, where it was used to show bullets gliding through the air in slow motion past the character Neo's head. The effect was achieved using a set of still cameras surrounding the subject, which were fired sequentially or all at the same time, depending on the desired effect. The resulting frames were then displayed consecutively to produce the iconic bullet time effect[5].\n\nThe term \"bullet time\" was first used in the original script of The Matrix, and it has since become a commonly applied expression in popular culture. The effect's inception predates cinema itself, with its roots going back to Eadweard Muybridge's photographs of galloping horses in 1878, which demonstrated the concept of bullet time by changing the viewer's perspective to create the illusion of movement[5][3].\n\nThe Matrix's version of the effect was created by John Gaeta and Manex Visual Effects, and it has been widely adopted in various visual media, from advertisements to music videos to film and even live events. The technique involves using multiple cameras to give the impression of time slowing down or standing still altogether, and it has been used to capture dynamic action scenes and create cinematic effects[3].\n\nThe bullet time effect is achieved by using a series of still cameras surrounding the subject, which are activated in rapid succession. The resulting frames are then displayed consecutively with additional CGI interpolated frames, creating the effect of the camera moving faster than the subject. This allows viewers to see 360 degrees of an action in slow motion with dynamic camera movement[4].\n\nIn summary, \"bullet time\" is a visual effect that creates the impression of time slowing down or standing still altogether, and it was first popularized in the 1999 film The Matrix. The effect is achieved using multiple cameras to capture still frames that are then displayed consecutively, creating the iconic slow-motion, dynamic camera movement seen in the film[5][4].",

The resulting frames were then displayed consecutively to produce an orbiting viewpoint of an action frozen in time or as hyper-slow-motion[6]. The Matrix's version of the effect was created by John Gaeta and Manex Visual Effects[6]. The iconic scene where Neo dodges Agent Smith's bullets required around 120 still cameras, placed one next to the other, to create the illusion of motion[8]. The effect combines gunfight action scenes, superhuman bullet-dodging, and time-slice effects, making it unique[6]. The term \"bullet time\" was popularized due to the use of the effect in The Matrix[7].",

The event was specifically created for Kipchoge and was supported by 41 pacemakers who assisted him throughout the attempt[1]. However, it's important to note that due to the presence of pacemakers, delivery of hydration by bicycle, and the lack of open competition, the achievement was not eligible to be ratified as a marathon world record and is not recognized as such by World Athletics[1]. This historic achievement was the result of a perfectly executed strategy devised by Sir Dave Brailsford and the INEOS 1:59 Performance Team[2]. The course was carefully selected to minimize the number of corners, ensuring a high ratio of straightaways to corners, and the final distance was 42.195 kilometers plus at most two centimeters[3]. The INEOS 1:59 Challenge has been widely celebrated, and event highlights are available on YouTube[5].",

This historic achievement was widely celebrated, and Kipchoge's remarkable feat has been compared to other iconic moments in sports history, such as Sir Roger Bannister's sub-four-minute mile and Usain Bolt's 100m world record. The event was specifically created for Kipchoge and held in Vienna, Austria, with 41 pacemakers assisting him throughout the attempt[1][2][3]. Despite the extraordinary nature of this accomplishment, it's important to note that due to the presence of pacemakers, delivery of hydration by bicycle, and the lack of open competition, the achievement was not eligible to be ratified as a marathon world record and is not recognized as such by World Athletics[2].",

The event was specifically created for Kipchoge and held in Vienna, Austria, with 41 pacemakers assisting him throughout the attempt[1].

The course was designed to have a minimum number of corners, with the final point set at 42.195 kilometers plus at most two centimeters[3].

The Games saw 10,625 athletes compete, accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries, with 301 medal events in 28 different sports[1][2]. This event also marked the first time Athens hosted the Games since their first modern incarnation in 1896 as well as the return of the Olympic games to its birthplace[2]. The 2004 Games were generally deemed to be a success, with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world[2]. The excitement surrounding the homecoming was tempered by security concerns related to Athens’s proximity to the politically volatile Middle East, but the Games ultimately went smoothly[5].",

The states of Serbia and Montenegro, which participated at the 2004 Games jointly as Serbia and Montenegro, competed separately for the first time since Serbia last participated in 1912. Montenegro made its debut appearance, as the Montenegrin Olympic Committee was accepted as a new National Olympic Committee in 2007.
